PRIVACY: Your event data is processed by the gadget within your browser and is not sent anywhere else.

The main difference between this code and an original - you need only title for event, no need of an aditional description field editing.
You need just write an title like this one "Project | Task description | ...", no more description editing "tags: Project, task description, ..."
